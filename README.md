# Diabetes Prediction Frontend

This is the frontend for the **Diabetes Prediction App**, a tool that helps assess an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on provided inputs. This frontend interfaces with the prediction API and displays results to the user.

## Overview

The current frontend is part of an ongoing project aimed at providing a streamlined, user-friendly experience for individuals to assess their diabetes risk. Users can input their medical and lifestyle information, and the app will generate a prediction result.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Collects data on various health factors such as age, BMI, blood sugar levels, and more.
- **Prediction Result Display**: Shows the result of the diabetes prediction.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Loading Indicator**: A circular blur modal is displayed while fetching the prediction to indicate that the result is being processed.

## Refactoring Status

The code is currently being refactored to improve maintainability, performance, and scalability. We are in the process of restructuring and optimizing components and logic. As part of this process, the **old code** (which is located in the previous repository) is being revised for better clarity, consistency, and modularity.

## Current Setup

The current version of the frontend has been refactored with the following updates:

- **Modularized Components**: Components have been separated into distinct files for better readability and easier maintenance.
- **Responsive Design Improvements**: Additional refinements for mobile responsiveness.
- **Code Optimization**: Reorganization and optimization for better performance and maintainability.
